## Description 

Welcome to the Fantasy Futball app!
[Check it out!](fantasyfutball.surge.sh) 

Fantasy Futball is an app that allows users to create an account, build, edit and delete rosters for their own personal fantasy teams. 

## Fantasy Futball Team

It was created by Giusseppe Del Vecchio, Jeanmax Delouches, and Frenchy French. Giusseppe built the React app, Frenchy built the backend, and Jeanmax created the frontend. Together, they coded out authorization peer-to-peer and each handled components and functionality wherever necessary. 

## Specs and Styling 

This site was created using, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Express. 

It has two databases one for storing users and a second to store thier rosters. The two databases share a one to many relationship.

The application was built mobile first with its breakpoint being 520px. 

### Typography

The font family **Viga** was chosen for its similarity to the *FIFA* font and the body font family is written in **Open Sans** to stay consistent with the *FIFA* brand.

## Next Steps

The Fantasy Futball team would like to build out a grandchild relationship database to handle the players that belong to the rosters. We have already built out the many-to-many relationship, and plan to implement it down the line. 

We would also like to reference an API that would allow users to search through players and add them to their roster as an alternative to typing out each player and image.

We would also like to make it possible for users to upload images, or use an image url, rather than only an image url.
